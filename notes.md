# Samy notes on nasa project

hello team this some notes and links that i found that could deem useful in our quest hope you enjoy the ride  

## note

the data comes in two forms

1. time series
2. processed data (tabular)

in your terminal type

```{powershell}
winget install GNU.Wget2
```
which will install wget from the GNU ecosystem 

to make this project easy to use type 

```{powershell}
winget install astral-sh.uv
``
thin do a **uv sync** 

## important concepts  

- transient method
- classification
- API 
- time series 
- machine learning 
- web app 
- deep learning
- CNN ( exploit spatial structure by learning local features that are detected across the entire input)
